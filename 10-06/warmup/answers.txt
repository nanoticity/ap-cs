Return types are the type of the information the method returns. Ex. when you write "return 1;" then in the function decleration you have to add "public int myVoid() {}"
You can return the information that you calculate in your variable. For example, you can give something back to the code.
No, you cannot return more than one datatype. You need to write a seperate function.
